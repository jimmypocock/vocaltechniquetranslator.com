# Vocal Technique Translation Guide for Popular Songs

## How to Use This Guide

This guide helps singers translate English lyrics into easier-to-sing versions that keep your throat open and relaxed. Think of it like changing "tight" words into "open" words while still sounding like the original. Each word shows you exactly how to pronounce it for better singing.

## Part I: Most Common Song Words & How to Sing Them

### Love & Relationship Words (The Big 150)

#### Words with Two Vowel Sounds (Diphthongs)

These words have vowels that change sound - hold the first sound longer!

**The "I" Sound Family:**

- **mind** → "mah-eend" (same pattern)

## Part V: Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

### The Golden Rules

1. **Diphthongs** (two-vowel sounds): Hold the first vowel for 80-90% of the note
2. **Consonant Clusters**: Make them quick and light
3. **Word Endings**: Release gently, never cut off hard
4. **Word Beginnings**: Start with air, not from your throat

### Problem Solver Quick List

**If the word has "I" sound** → Sing "ah-ee" (mostly "ah")
**If the word has "AY" sound** → Sing "eh-ee" (mostly "eh")
**If the word ends in "T" or "D"** → Make it super soft
**If the word starts with a vowel** → Add a tiny "h" sound before it
**If there are multiple consonants** → Separate them with tiny vowel sounds

### Style Guide

**Pop/Rock Style:**

- Can be closer to speech
- Diphthongs can close earlier
- Consonants can be breathier
